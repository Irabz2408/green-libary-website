# Green-libary-website

*  Capstone Project titled "Enhancing a Community Library Website" for the "Greenwood Community Library." The goal is to make the website more engaging and informative by adding a "Book Reviews" section and updating the "Events" page with upcoming community events. The website currently includes basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us.

## The project involves two contributors, Morgan and Jamie. Morgan will focus on developing the "Book Reviews" section, while Jamie will update the "Events" page.
The objectives of the project are:


* Practice cloning a repository and working with branches in Git.

- Gain experience in staging, committing, and pushing changes from both developers.

- Create pull requests and merge them after resolving any potential conflicts.
